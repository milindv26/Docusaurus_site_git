# Instrumental Variables

## Motivation
<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
Instrumental variables (IV) are a powerful statistical tool used to address the issue of endogeneity, a common problem in econometric analyses where explanatory variables are correlated with the error term. Endogeneity can arise from various sources, such as omitted variable bias, measurement error, or simultaneous causality, leading to biased and inconsistent estimates in ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The use of IV is crucial in these scenarios as it allows for the isolation of the exogenous variation in the explanatory variables, providing a more reliable estimate of the causal effect.

The instrumental variable approach involves finding a variable (the instrument) that is correlated with the endogenous explanatory variable but uncorrelated with the error term. This instrument serves as a source of exogenous variation, effectively 'breaking' the link between the explanatory variable and the error term. By doing so, IV estimation addresses the endogeneity issue by ensuring that the correlation between the explanatory variable and the error term is no longer a concern, leading to consistent and **unbiased** estimates. This makes IV particularly useful in empirical studies where controlled experiments are not feasible, and endogeneity poses a significant threat to causal inference.
