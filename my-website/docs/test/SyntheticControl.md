# Synthetic Control Method

## Introduction

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
The synthetic control method (SCM) is a powerful statistical tool used in the field of causal inference, primarily in social sciences and economics. This method is designed to estimate the effect of an intervention or treatment when a traditional randomized control trial is not feasible. In this introduction, we will explore the origins, principles, applications, and advantages of the synthetic control method, as well as some of its limitations.

SCM was developed in the early 21st century, with seminal work by Alberto Abadie and Javier Gardeazabal in 2003 being particularly influential. It emerged as a response to the limitations of existing methodologies in assessing the impact of policy interventions in situations where experimental data was either unavailable or unethical to obtain. The method revolutionized the way researchers could study the effects of policy changes, natural disasters, or other large-scale events on economic and social outcomes.

At its core, SCM involves the construction of a synthetic control group that best resembles the characteristics of the treatment group before the intervention. This is achieved by using a weighted combination of control units (such as other regions, countries, or entities that did not receive the treatment) to create a synthetic version of the treated unit. The key is to find weights that minimize the pre-intervention differences between the treated unit and its synthetic counterpart in terms of observed characteristics and outcomes.

The method relies heavily on pre-treatment data to ensure that the synthetic control is as similar as possible to the actual unit receiving the intervention. The difference in post-intervention outcomes between the treated unit and its synthetic control is then attributed to the intervention.

SCM has been applied in various research contexts, particularly in policy analysis. For instance, it has been used to assess the economic impact of conflict, the effects of political reforms, the consequences of large-scale natural disasters, and the efficacy of public health interventions. Its versatility makes it a valuable tool in fields as diverse as economics, political science, public health, and environmental studies.

One of the primary advantages of the SCM is its ability to construct a counterfactual scenario in cases where traditional experimental designs are not possible. Unlike simple before-and-after comparisons, it provides a more robust way to account for confounding factors and pre-existing trends. This method is particularly useful when dealing with heterogeneous units (like countries or regions), where aggregate data may mask important local variations.

However, the synthetic control method is not without its limitations. The accuracy of its estimates depends heavily on the availability and quality of pre-treatment data. There is also the challenge of subjectivity in selecting predictor variables and in choosing the units that form the synthetic control. Moreover, the method assumes that the relationship between the predictors and outcomes remains stable over time, which may not always hold true.

SCM represents a significant advancement in the field of causal inference, offering a sophisticated approach to evaluating the impact of interventions in cases where traditional experimental methods are impractical. By constructing a synthetic control group that closely mirrors the characteristics of the treated group prior to an intervention, researchers can isolate and estimate the effect of the intervention more accurately than with traditional comparative methods.

This method has gained widespread acceptance and is increasingly being used in various disciplines to address complex policy questions. Its ability to create a credible counterfactual has provided valuable insights in areas ranging from economic policy to public health. For instance, it has been instrumental in understanding the economic impact of the Euro adoption in various countries and the effects of tobacco control policies in different states.

Despite its many strengths, the method requires careful implementation. The selection of control units and predictors must be done meticulously to ensure the synthetic control group is a close match to the treated unit. Additionally, researchers must be cautious about over-interpreting results, especially in cases where the fit between the synthetic control and treated unit is not very tight.

The method also faces challenges when dealing with multiple treated units or when interventions occur at different times. Recent advancements in the methodology, such as the generalized synthetic control method, are addressing some of these challenges, expanding the potential applications of this approach.

**New**  
The Synthetic Control Method (SCM) stands as a pivotal statistical tool in the realm of causal inference, particularly within the social sciences and economics. This innovative method is tailored to estimate the impact of various interventions or treatments, especially in scenarios where conducting a traditional randomized control trial is not viable. The essence of SCM is to provide a reliable and scientifically sound alternative for analyzing the effects of interventions, thereby filling a crucial gap in research methodologies. This introduction sets the stage to delve into the origins, fundamental principles, applications, and merits of SCM, along with a consideration of its limitations.

Developed in the early 21st century, SCM's foundation was laid by the seminal work of Alberto Abadie and Javier Gardeazabal in 2003. Their research marked a significant turning point, addressing the inadequacies of previous methods in evaluating the impact of policy interventions, particularly in situations where the use of experimental data was not feasible or ethically justifiable. This method brought a revolutionary perspective to the study of policy changes, natural disasters, and other significant events, enabling researchers to comprehensively analyze their effects on socio-economic outcomes. The emergence of SCM symbolized a methodological breakthrough in the assessment of large-scale interventions and their wide-ranging impacts.

Central to SCM is the creation of a synthetic control group, meticulously constructed to mirror the pre-intervention characteristics of the treatment group. This is accomplished through a careful amalgamation of control units—entities such as regions, countries, or other groups that did not receive the treatment—resulting in a synthetic counterpart to the treated unit. The critical aspect of this process is identifying the appropriate weights to minimize the differences between the treated unit and its synthetic analog, focusing on observed characteristics and outcomes before the intervention. This process underscores SCM's emphasis on precision and customization in constructing control groups, ensuring a high degree of accuracy in its estimations.

SCM's applications span a diverse range of research areas, notably in policy analysis. It has been instrumental in evaluating the economic ramifications of conflicts, the outcomes of political reforms, the aftermath of large-scale natural disasters, and the effectiveness of public health interventions. This versatility renders SCM an invaluable tool across various fields, including economics, political science, public health, and environmental studies. One of the key strengths of SCM lies in its ability to create a counterfactual scenario, particularly in cases where traditional experimental approaches are unfeasible. It offers a robust framework for accounting for confounding factors and pre-existing trends, especially useful when dealing with heterogeneous units like countries or regions. However, SCM is not without challenges. The accuracy of its estimates relies heavily on the availability and quality of pre-treatment data. Moreover, the method faces the challenge of subjectivity in selecting predictor variables and choosing the appropriate units to form the synthetic control. Additionally, there is an underlying assumption that the relationship between the predictors and outcomes remains constant over time, which may not always be the case.

Despite these challenges, SCM has marked a significant advancement in the field of causal inference. It provides a sophisticated and nuanced approach to evaluating the impact of interventions in situations where traditional experimental methods are impractical. By creating a synthetic control group that closely resembles the characteristics of the treated group before the intervention, researchers are able to isolate and more accurately estimate the effect of the intervention compared to traditional comparative methods. This approach has gained widespread acceptance and is increasingly being used across various disciplines to tackle complex policy questions. Its capability to generate a credible counterfactual has offered valuable insights in areas ranging from economic policy to public health. For example, SCM has played a crucial role in understanding the economic impact of the Euro adoption across different countries and the effects of tobacco control policies in various states.

However, the effectiveness of SCM depends on careful implementation. The selection of control units and predictors requires meticulous attention to ensure that the synthetic control group is a close match to the treated unit. Researchers also need to be cautious in interpreting results, particularly in instances where the alignment between the synthetic control and the treated unit is not exact. The method also faces specific challenges in scenarios involving multiple treated units or interventions occurring at different times. To address these issues, recent advancements in the methodology, such as the generalized synthetic control method, have been developed. These enhancements are expanding the potential applications of SCM, allowing it to adapt to a broader array of research scenarios and continue its evolution as a vital tool in the analysis of policy interventions and their impacts.

In this comprehensive review paper, we will embark on a threefold exploration of the synthetic control method. Initially, our focus will be on delving into the pertinent literature surrounding this method. This foundational segment aims to encapsulate the historical context, key developments, and the broader academic discourse that has shaped and defined the synthetic control method over time. Following this, we will transition to a detailed exposition of the method itself. This will encompass a thorough examination of its underlying principles and operational mechanics. The objective here is to offer a lucid and nuanced understanding of how the synthetic control method functions and its significance in empirical research. Finally, the paper will culminate with a critical analysis of the method, highlighting notable critiques that have emerged in scholarly circles. In addressing these criticisms, we will not only engage in a discussion of their validity but also propose potential pathways and methodological refinements that could mitigate these concerns, thereby enhancing the robustness and applicability of the synthetic control method. This holistic approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the method, its impact, and its evolving landscape within the realms of social science research.

## Literature Review: The Synthetic Control Method in Policy Evaluation

#### Introduction
The synthetic control method, a significant innovation in policy evaluation, has gained substantial attention in the field of econometrics. As highlighted by Susan Athey and Guido Imbens in their survey for the Journal of Economic Perspectives, this method is "arguably the most important innovation in the policy evaluation literature in the last 15 years" (Athey and Imbens, 2017). This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the development, application, and impact of the synthetic control method in various fields.

#### Evolution and Methodological Foundations
Originally proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and further refined in Abadie et al. (2010), the synthetic control method was developed to estimate the effects of aggregate interventions — such as those impacting cities, regions, or countries — on a specific outcome of interest. This method constructs a synthetic version of the treated unit by using a combination of unaffected units, offering a more appropriate comparison than any single unaffected unit alone. This approach formalizes the selection of comparison units using a data-driven procedure, enhancing the robustness of comparative case studies.

#### Diverse Applications in Policy Evaluation
The versatility of the synthetic control method is evident in its wide range of applications across various policy issues. For instance, it has been employed to study the effects of right-to-carry laws (Donohue et al., 2019), legalized prostitution (Cunningham and Shah, 2018), and immigration policy (Bohn et al., 2014). Additionally, its applications extend to understanding corporate political connections (Acemoglu et al., 2016), taxation policies (Kleven et al., 2013), and the impact of organized crime (Pinotti, 2015). 

#### Impact Beyond Economics
While the synthetic control method originated in economics, its utility has transcended into social sciences, biomedical disciplines, engineering, and more (Heersink et al., 2017; Pieters et al., 2017). This cross-disciplinary adoption underscores the method's flexibility and effectiveness in various research contexts.

#### Usage in Debates and Beyond Academia
The method has been pivotal in recent prominent debates, such as the effects of immigration (Borjas, 2017; Peri and Yasenov, 2019) and minimum wages (Allegretto et al., 2017; Jardim et al., 2017; Neumark and Wascher, 2017; Reich et al., 2017). Outside academia, it has gained attention in the popular press (Guo, 2015; Douglas, 2018) and is widely adopted by multilateral organizations, think tanks, governmental agencies, and consulting firms. A notable example includes its role in evaluating the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Intensive Partnerships for Effective Teaching program (Gutierrez et al., 2016).

#### Critiques and Extensions
While the synthetic control method is highly regarded, it is not without critiques. Traditional regression analysis techniques, often used in policy evaluation, require large samples and many observed instances of the event or intervention of interest. The synthetic control method addresses this need

 by enabling the estimation of effects in cases where large-scale but infrequent interventions occur, especially in aggregate units like regions or countries. However, the selection of comparison units and the reliance on pre-intervention characteristics can introduce challenges and biases. Furthermore, the assumption that pre-intervention trends between the treated and synthetic control units can be extrapolated into the post-intervention period is a subject of debate. 

The method has also evolved to accommodate settings with a large number of units, broadening its applicability and addressing some of the earlier critiques. This evolution is discussed in-depth in Section 8 of the referenced works, highlighting the method's adaptability and growing sophistication.

#### Comparative Case Studies and Synthetic Control
Comparative case studies, traditionally used to evaluate large-scale events or interventions, often rely on informal selection of comparison units. The synthetic control method enhances this approach by formalizing the selection process, thus providing a more objective and data-driven basis for comparison. This advancement is particularly important when the units of observation are a small number of aggregate entities, where no single unit alone may provide a good comparison.

#### Conclusion
In summary, the synthetic control method represents a significant breakthrough in the field of policy evaluation, offering a robust and versatile tool for assessing the impacts of large-scale interventions. Its applications across a variety of domains, from economics to social sciences, and its adoption beyond academia, underscore its importance and effectiveness. While it is not without limitations and continues to evolve, the synthetic control method remains a key component in the toolkit of researchers and policymakers alike, providing insights and evidence in the complex world of policy analysis and evaluation.

## The Method

This section describes the principles and operational mechanics of the SCM.

### The Setting

The data we analyze is comprised of observations from $J + 1$ units, labeled as $j = 1, 2, ..., J + 1$. We proceed under the assumption that the first unit $(j = 1)$ has received the treatment or has been subject to the policy intervention being studied. The remaining units, from $j = 2$ to $J + 1$, constitute what is referred to as the "donor pool", which consists of units that have not been treated and therefore serve as potential comparisons. 

Our dataset encompasses observations over $T$ time periods, with the initial $T_0$ periods occurring before the implementation of the policy intervention. For each unit $j$ during each time period $t$, we record the outcome variable of interest, denoted by $Y_{jt}$. In addition to the outcomes, we collect data on $k$ predictors for each unit, represented as $X_{1j}, ..., X_{kj}$. These predictors might include values of the outcome variable prior to the intervention and are not influenced by the intervention itself. The predictors for all untreated units are compiled into a matrix $\bold{X_0}$ of size $k \times J$, where each column corresponds to a unit $j$ and contains the predictor values for that unit.

To estimate the intervention's effect, we consider the potential outcomes for unit $j = 1$, which is the treated unit, in the absence of the intervention, labeled as $Y{t}^{N}$​, and the actual observed outcomes post-intervention, labeled as $Y_{t}^{I}$​, for time periods $t > T_0$. The difference in these potential and observed outcomes for the treated unit, for any given period after the intervention, defines the effect of the intervention, denoted by $\tau_t$​, which is mathematically expressed as the difference
$$
Y_{t}^{I} - Y_{t}^{N}
$$
