# Kendall Tau Distance

**In this Jupyter notebook, we will calculate the Kendall $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ distance for a slightly complex scenario described below.**

## Scenario
Suppose there are two individuals, A and B. Each person needs to rank their top 5 favorite fruits from a list of 11 fruits. How can we calculate the Kendall $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ distance in this case?

**Procedure:** To calculate Kendall's Tau for two persons, A and B, who have ranked their 5 most favorite fruits out of a list of 11 fruits, follow these steps:

1. **Construct the rankings:** Create two rankings for the 5 fruits each person has ranked. Since not all 11 fruits are ranked by each person, you will have partial rankings. You need to handle the unranked fruits by assigning them a lower rank or ignoring them in the comparison.

2. **Extend the rankings:** For simplicity, extend the rankings to include all 11 fruits. Assign a rank of 6 (or any consistent low rank) to the unranked fruits.

3. **Create pairs:** Form pairs of the fruits for comparison. Since there are 11 fruits, you'll form ${11\choose 2} = 55$ pairs.

4. **Count concordant and discordant pairs:**   
   * A pair $(i,j)$ is concordant if the ranking order of the fruits is the same for both persons. That is, if fruit $i$ is ranked higher than fruit $j$ by both A and B or lower by both A and B.
   * A pair $(i,j)$ is discordant if the ranking order of the fruits is different for the two persons. That is, if fruit $i$ is ranked higher than fruit $j$ by one person but lower by the other.

5. **Calculate Kendall's Tau:**
$$
\tau = \frac{C - D}{n\choose2}
$$
where $C$ is the number of concordant pairs, $D$ is the number of discordant pairs, and $n$ is the number of pairs (which is 55 in this case).

## Example

Suppose the list of 11 fruits is: [Apple, Banana, Cherry, Date, Elderberry, Fig, Grape, Honeydew, Kiwi, Lemon, Mango].

Person A ranks: Apple (1), Banana (2), Cherry (3), Date (4), Elderberry (5)  
Person B ranks: Apple (1), Banana (2), Grape (3), Kiwi (4), Lemon (5)

**Step 1:** Construct the rankings:

| Fruit       | A | B |
|-------------|---|---|
| Apple       | 1 | 1 |
| Banana      | 2 | 2 |
| Cherry      | 3 | 6 |
| Date        | 4 | 6 |
| Elderberry  | 5 | 6 |
| Fig         | 6 | 6 |
| Grape       | 6 | 3 |
| Honeydew    | 6 | 6 |
| Kiwi        | 6 | 4 |
| Lemon       | 6 | 5 |
| Mango       | 6 | 6 |

**Step 2:** Form pairs and count concordant and discordant pairs:

| Pair               | A's Rank (i, j) | B's Rank (i, j) | Concordant/Discordant |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------------|

**Step 3:** Calculate Kendall's Tau:  
Count of concordant pairs $C=43$  
Count of discordant pairs $D=12$  
Total pairs $n=55$

$$
\tau = \frac{C-D}{11\choose 2}=\frac{42-13}{55}\approx 0.53
$$

So, Kendall's Tau for the two persons' rankings is approximately $0.53$.
