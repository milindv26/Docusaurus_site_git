# Greedy Algorithm

## Basics
<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
A greedy algorithm is a problem-solving technique that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit or the largest local gain. In simpler terms, a greedy algorithm makes a series of choices, each of which looks the best at the moment, without reconsidering those choices later on.

**Key Characteristics:**  
    * **Local Optimization:** At each step, the algorithm selects the option that seems the best right now (the local optimum) without worrying about whether it leads to the best global solution.

    * **Greedy Choice Property:** The choice made by the algorithm at each step is the one that appears best according to some criterion. This decision is made without considering the future consequences.

    * **Optimal Substructure:** A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

## Demonstration
Hereâ€™s a demonstration of the Greedy Algorithm applied to the fractional knapsack problem.
