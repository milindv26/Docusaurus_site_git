# Dan Boneh's Cryptography Course Introduction

## Welcome and Overview

- **Instructor:** Dan Boneh
- **Course:** Cryptography
- **Institution:** Stanford University
- **Format:** 
  - Experimenting with recording lectures
  - Lectures available online for everyone

## Course Goals

1. Teach cryptographic primitives
2. Use cryptographic primitives correctly
3. Reason about security of constructions
4. Understand various abstractions and security proofs
5. Ability to reason about security and break insecure constructions

## Course Approach and Recommendations

- **Note-Taking:** Encouraged to take notes in your own words
- **Pace:** 
  - Videos go faster than normal lectures
  - Pause and think about the material
- **Interactive Elements:** 
  - Pop-up questions in videos
  - Encouraged to answer them

## Cryptography in Practice

- Used everywhere in computing
- Examples:
  - Web traffic (HTTPS)
  - Wi-Fi (WPA2, part of 801.11i)
  - Cell phone traffic (GSM)
  - Bluetooth traffic
- Detailed coverage of SSL and 802.11i
- File encryption for data protection
- Content protection (DVDs with CSS, Blu-Ray with AACS)
- User authentication

## Secure Communication

- **Example:** Laptop communicating with a web server
- **Characters:** Alice (laptop) and Bob (server)
- **Protocol:** HTTPS (SSL/TLS)
- **Goals:** Prevent eavesdropping and tampering
- **Process:** 
  - Handshake protocol to establish a shared secret key
  - Use of public key cryptography (covered in the second part of the course)
  - Secure communication using the shared secret key

## Protecting Files on Disk

- Encrypted files for confidentiality and integrity
- Similarity between secure communication and file encryption
- Concept of Alice communicating with her future self

## Symmetric Encryption Systems

- **Basics:** 
  - Shared secret key (k) unknown to attackers
  - Two algorithms: Encryption (E) and Decryption (D)
- **Important Note:** Encryption algorithms should be publicly known and peer-reviewed

## Types of Keys

1. **One-Time Keys:** Used for a single message (e.g., email)
2. **Many-Time Keys:** Used for multiple messages (e.g., file encryption)

## Important Considerations in Cryptography

- Not a solution to all security problems (e.g., software bugs, social engineering)
- Useless if implemented incorrectly (e.g., WEP as a bad example)
- Don't invent or design your own cryptography; use standard primitives
