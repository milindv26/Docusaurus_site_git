# Introduction

## Plaintext and Ciphertext

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
**Plaintext** refers to the original, readable, and unencrypted message or data. It's the information that needs to be protected or secured through encryption to prevent unauthorized access or interception.

When plaintext is subjected to encryption using cryptographic algorithms, it transforms into **ciphertext**, which is the encrypted and unreadable form of the original message.

## Symmetric Ciphers

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
Symmetric ciphers are cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for both encryption and decryption of data. This means that the sender and the receiver must have access to the same secret key.

## Substitution Ciphers

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
In its simplest form, this cipher replaces each letter of the plaintext with another letter. For example, every 'A' in the plaintext might be replaced with 'D', every 'B' might be replaced with 'E', and so on.

### Caesar Cipher 

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
One of the earliest and simplest forms of substitution cipher, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it. It involves "shifting" the alphabet a certain number of places down or up. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so forth.
