# Kendall Tau Distance

**In this Jupyter notebook, we will calculate the Kendall $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ distance for a slightly complex scenario described below.**

**Case:** Suppose there are two individuals, A and B. Each person needs to rank their top 5 favorite fruits from a list of 11 fruits. How can we calculate the Kendall $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ distance in this case?

**Procedure:** To calculate Kendall's Tau for two persons, A and B, who have ranked their 5 most favorite fruits out of a list of 11 fruits, follow these steps:

1. **Construct the rankings:** Create two rankings for the 5 fruits each person has ranked. Since not all 11 fruits are ranked by each person, you will have partial rankings. You need to handle the unranked fruits by assigning them a lower rank or ignoring them in the comparison.

2. **Extend the rankings:** For simplicity, extend the rankings to include all 11 fruits. Assign a rank of 6 (or any consistent low rank) to the unranked fruits.

3. **Create pairs:** Form pairs of the fruits for comparison. Since there are 11 fruits, you'll form $11\choose 2 = 55$ pairs.
