# Markov's Inequality

## Definition

If $X$ is a non-negative random variable and $a > 0$, then the probability that $X$ is at least $a$ is at most the expectation of $X$ divided by $a.$

Mathematically
$$
P(X\geq a) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{a}.
$$

## Proof
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[X]:&=\int_{-\infin}^{\infty}x f_X(x) dx\\
\end{align*}
$$
since $X$ is non-negative
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[X]&=\int_{0}^{\infty}x f_X(x) dx\\
\end{align*}
$$
for any $a>0$
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[X]&\geq \int_{a}^{\infty}x f_X(x) dx\\
\end{align*}
$$
since $x>a$ in the integrated region
$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}[X]&\geq \int_{a}^{\infty}x f_X(x) dx\geq \int_{a}^{\infty}a f_X(x) dx\\
&\geq a\int_{a}^{\infty} f_X(x) dx\\
&\geq aP(X\geq a)\\
\implies P(X\geq a) &\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{a}. \hspace{15px} \blacksquare
\end{align*}
$$

**Note:** We will use Markov's Inequality to prove Chebyshev's Inequality.

## Example

Let $X$ is a random variable representing the income of an individual in the population. Since $X$ is income, it can not be negative.

Markov's inequality can be written as
$$
\begin{align*}
    P(X\geq m \mathbb{E}[X]) &\leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{m \mathbb{E}[X]}\\
    &\leq \frac{1}{m}.
\end{align*}
$$
Let $m=5$
$$
\begin{align*}
    P(X\geq 5 \mathbb{E}[X]) &\leq 20\%\\
\end{align*}
$$
This inequality states that the proportion of the population with an income more than $5$ times the average is at most $20\%$. In other words, no more than $20\%$ of the population can earn more than $5$ times the average income.
