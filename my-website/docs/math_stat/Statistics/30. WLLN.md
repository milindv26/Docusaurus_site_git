# Weak Law of Large Numbers

## Definition
<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
The Weak Law of Large Numbers (WLLN) states that, for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $X_1,X_2,X_3,…,X_n$​ with a finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, the sample average
$$
\bar{X}_n=\frac{1}{n}(X_1+X_2+…+X_n)
$$
converges in probability towards the expected value $\mu$ as $n$ approaches $\infty$. In mathematical terms, for any positive number $\epsilon$,
$$
P(|\bar{X}_n - \mu|<\epsilon)\rightarrow 1\text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty.
$$
This can also be written as
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \bar{X}_n\xrightarrow{p}\mu
$$
where $\xrightarrow{p}$ denotes convergence in probability.  

It's important to note that, for any finite sample size, there's still a non-zero probability that the sample mean will significantly differ from the population mean. It does not guarantee that the sample mean will equal the population mean, only that it will get arbitrarily close to it as the sample size increases.
