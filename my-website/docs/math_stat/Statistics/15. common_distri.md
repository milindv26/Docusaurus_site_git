# Common Distributions

Here we will discuss some common distributions.

## Binomial Distribution

### Definition
<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials in an experiment with two possible outcomes, often labeled as "success" and "failure". Each trial, also known as a Bernoulli trial, has a constant probability of success, denoted by $p$, and a constant probability of failure, $1-p$. The binomial distribution is defined by two parameters: the number of trials $n$ and the probability of success $p$ in each trial. The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the formula (also called **Probability Mass Function**)
$$
P(X=k)=\binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k},
$$
where $\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient. This distribution is widely used in scenarios ranging from quality control in manufacturing to evaluating the probability of a certain number of successes in a set number of attempts in various fields such as biology, finance, and sports.

### Expectation

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}[X]&=\sum_{k=0}^n k P(X=k)\\
    &=\sum_{k=0}^n k \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n k \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\
    &=\sum_{k=1}^n k \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}\\
    &=np\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!}p^{k-1}(1-p)^{n-k}\\
    &=np\sum_{k=1}^n \underbrace{\binom{n-1}{k-1}p^{k-1}(1-p)^{n-k}}_{PMF}\\
    &=np
\end{align*}
