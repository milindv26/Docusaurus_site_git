# Introduction

## Plaintext and Ciphertext

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
It refers to the original, readable, and unencrypted message or data. It's the information that needs to be protected or secured through encryption to prevent unauthorized access or interception.

When plaintext is subjected to encryption using cryptographic algorithms, it transforms into **ciphertext**, which is the encrypted and unreadable form of the original message.

## Symmetric Ciphers

Symmetric ciphers are cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for both encryption and decryption of data. This means that the sender and the receiver must have access to the same secret key.
