# Cake Eating Problem

**In this Jupyter notebook, we will study cake eating problem in 6 different levels.**

## Introduction

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify' }}>
Consider the problem of consuming a cake weighing 1000 grams in a manner that maximizes utility. This exercise serves as a model for dynamic optimization, a fundamental principle in economic theory. We will examine a series of scenarios, structured as incremental levels, each building upon the last. The initial level represents a straightforward decision framework, where the utility function is simple. As we advance, the complexity of the decision will increase, leading us to employ dynamic programming. This technique will enable us to solve for the optimal consumption strategy over time, accounting for the diminishing marginal utility and the intertemporal budget constraint imposed by the cake's finite size. By applying this iterative approach, we will derive a consumption path that yields the maximum cumulative utility.

## Level 1

**General Notations**



**Environment**
    
    * Utility function : Linear, here it is given by, $u(c)=2c$.
    * Total Utility, $U=\sum_{t=0}^{T-1} \beta^t u(c_t)$.
    * Time periods, $T=2$.
    * Cake at the beginning := $W_0 = 1000$ gms.
    * Cake consumed in period $t$ := $c_t$.
    * Cake left at time $t$ := $W_t=W_{t-1} - c_t$.
    * Time: Discrete.
    * Time discounting, $\beta=1$.
    * Some cake has to be eaten in each period. That is, $c_t>0, \forall t$.
    * There is no disutility in eating cake, hence in the end you would want to finish it. Therefore $W_T=0$

Total Utility, $U=\sum_{t=0}^1 \beta^t u(c_t)=u(c_0)+ \beta u(c_1)$.

Let me write down the problem in an analytical way:

Choose the sequence $\{c_t\}$ such that $\sum_{t=1}^T u(c_t)$ is maximum, that is,
$$
\argmax_{c_t} \sum_{t=1}^T u(c_t)
$$

At this level, the solution to the above problem satisfies the following conditions:
$$
\{c_1, c_2\} \in (0,1000)\text{ and }c_1+c_2=1000.
$$

One solution, for instance, is $\{2,998\}$. This sequence gives us utility $u(2) + u(998)= 4+1996=2000$.

In general, if we have time periods more than 2, let's say, 5, then the solution would satisfy the following conditions:
$$
\{c_1,.., c_{5}\} \in (0,1000)\text{ and }\sum_{t=1}^{5} c_t=1000.
$$

Total Utility, $U=\sum_{t=0}^4 \beta^t u(c_t)=\beta^0 u(c_0)+ \beta^1 u(c_1) + \beta^2 u(c_2) + \beta^3 u(c_3)+ \beta^4 u(c_4)$.

Let me write down the problem in an analytical way:

Choose the sequence $\{c_t\}$ such that $\sum_{t=1}^T u(c_t)$ is maximum, that is,
$$
\argmax_{c_t} \sum_{t=0}^4 u(c_t)
$$

At this level, the solution to the above problem satisfies the following conditions:
$$
\{c_1, c_2\} \in [0,1000]\text{ and }c_1+c_2=1000.
