# Maximum Likelihood Estimation

**In this Jupyter notebook, we will do the maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters, mean and standard deviation, of the normal distribution.**

## Likelihood Function

**PDF of normal distribution is given as follows:**
$$
f_X(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}}\cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2},
$$
where $\mu$ is mean and $\sigma$ is standard deviation.

Assuming we have a dataset comprising 1000 randomly selected observations from a normal distribution with a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of 7, independently and identically distributed (IID). The **likelihood function** corresponding to these 1000 observations is given as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
    L(\mu,\sigma, x_1, x_2,\cdots,x_{1000})&=\prod_{i=1}^{1000}f_X(x_i)\\
    &=
\end{align*}
$$
