# Perfect Secrecy

## Definition
An encryption scheme $(Gen, Enc, Dec)$ with message space $\mathcal{M}$ is perfectly secret if for every probability distribution for $M$, every message $m \in \mathcal{M}$, and every ciphertext $c \in \mathcal{C}$ for which $Pr[C = c] > 0$:
$$
Pr[M = m | C = c] =Pr[M = m].
$$
(The requirement that $Pr[C = c] > 0$ is a technical one needed to prevent conditioning on a zero probability event.)

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
This definition implies that in a perfectly secret encryption scheme, the ciphertext $c$ reveals no information about the plaintext $m$. Specifically, for any message $m$ within the message space $\mathcal{M}$ and any possible ciphertext $c$ in the ciphertext space $\mathcal{C}$, the probability of $m$ being the plaintext corresponding to $c$ is exactly the same as the probability of $m$ being chosen without any knowledge of $c$.

## OTP is Perfectly Secret

We will use the above definition to prove that One Time Pad is perfectly secret.

Given:  
$\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{C}=\{0,1\}^l,$ where $l$ is the length of message $m$,

$$
\begin{align*}
    Pr[C = c | M = m] &=Pr[K \oplus m = c | M = m],\\
&= Pr[K = m \oplus c | M = m],\\
&= Pr[K = m \oplus c] \hspace{3px}\text{ as K is independent of M},\\
&=\frac{1}{2^l}. \tag{1}
\end{align*} 
$$
$$
\begin{align*}
    Pr[C = c ] &=\sum_{m \in \mathcal{M} }Pr[C = c | M = m]\cdot Pr[M = m] \hspace{3px}\text{ using law of total probabilty},\\
&= \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M} }\frac{1}{2^l}\cdot Pr[M = m] ,\\
&= \frac{1}{2^l}\cdot \sum_{m \in \mathcal{M} } Pr[M = m] ,\\
&=\frac{1}{2^l}.1 \tag{2}
\end{align*} 
$$
Now we will use Bayes' theorem of conditional probability:
$$
\begin{align*}
    Pr[C = c | M = m  ] &= \frac{Pr[C = c \text{ and } M = m]} {Pr[M = m]},\\
    Pr[M = m | C = c  ] &= \frac{Pr[C = c \text{ and } M = m]} {Pr[C = c]},\\
    \implies Pr[M = m | C = c  ] &= \frac{Pr[C = c | M = m  ]\cdot Pr[M = m]} {Pr[C = c]},\\
\end{align*}
$$
using $(1)$ and $(2)$,
$$
\begin{align*}
    Pr[M = m | C = c  ] &= Pr[C = c].\hspace{10px}\blacksquare\\
\end{align*}
